<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi my name is Ali Bajwa. This is my attempt and an attempt which must succeed
  in order for me to provide myself with a stable family, social and work life.
  <br />
  I have seen the benefits which teck, coding and being a software develop
  provides. i am the second eldest out of 7 siblings. My journey to being this
  ventrue into the world of software development is rooted in the observations
  and experiences of my siblings who have entered the world of tech and reaped
  the rewards of the fruit it has provided them. i have been fortunante enough
  to the see the financial, social and stable life it has provided them and
  through reflecting on my own decisions i have come to realise my inability to
  see the wider picture post graduation from university has led me down a path
  which despite repeated attempts from my older sibling so switch career was
  falling on deaf ears. i must admit i should have listed to him and seen that
  he was only trying to teach me and push me down a route that will have been
  for my own benefit. but here i am now at the age of 30 switching careers which
  will have massive financial impact on the family household. i will make sure
  my attempts to swtich career will not be in failure, vein or filled with doubt
  and insecurities. However i will need to understand there will be periods of
  doubt but to not allow these doubts to cloud my goal and ambition to provide
  my family with the most secure future. i will become a software develop within
  1-2 years and make the switch from social worker once and for all.
  <strong>Insha'Allah</strong>
